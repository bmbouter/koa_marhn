===============
Surf the big mountain of AR-HMM data with this library.

A time series data generator that generates either Hidden Markov Model data, or Auto-Regressive Hidden Markov Model data, both of which are timeseries data. This allows for validation of software that estimates the parameters of a HMM or AR-HMM from timeseries data.

The name is inspired by Marhn Fullmer, who has assisted so many Computer Science students in their own learning over the years at North Carolina State University. This software is a small tribute to his tireless work.
